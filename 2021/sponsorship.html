<h1>Sponsorships</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is a community organized non-profit conference, and it would not be possible without the support of its amazing set of sponsors over the years. We invite your organization to be a sponsor of JuliaCon 2021.
  </p><p>
    JuliaCon is the largest annual conference organized around Julia, the fastest high-performance open source computing language for machine learning, artificial intelligence, life sciences, robotics, algorithmic trading, real-time analytics and more.
  </p>
  <p>Last year, Juliacon moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This move, though forced upon us by circumstance, allowed us to bring the conference to a 
    much larger community. Over 10,000 users from 115 countries registered for the conference, and over 30,000 watched the conference talks within one month of 
    the event. Juliacon therefore offers you the unique opportunity to present your company and your product to a worldwide audience of engaged scientific programmers.
