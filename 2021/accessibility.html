<h1>Accessibility at JuliaCon</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee. In light of our
	<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/covid19/">announcement</a> to shift JuliaCon online, our accessibility plans for
  this year are likely to be very different from prior events.
 </p><p>
  We will strive to ensure that the online platforms are compatible with screen
  readers, and we shall attempt to close caption all our talks.
 </p><p>
    Please reach out to the organising committee at juliacon@julialang.org for any
	additional concerns.
