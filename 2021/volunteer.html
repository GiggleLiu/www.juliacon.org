<h1>Roles</h1>
    <h3>Mentors to new speakers</h3>
    <p>
        JuliaCon 2020 will match first-time JuliaCon speakers desiring guidance to
        experienced speakers willing to mentor. We are expecting a time commitment
        of maximally a few hours in which mentors will provide feedback on a novice
        speaker's presentation.

        Please let us know if you would like to be mentored or if you are willing to mentor a first-time speaker for JuliaCon 2020!
    </p>

    <h3>Proceedings reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        JuliaCon will be offering proceedings, and we need
        reviewers to assess submissions. Our review process will be similar to that of
        the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
    </p>

    <h3>Virtual volunteers</h3>
    <p>
        Our virtual volunteers help keep the conference running smoothly by helping with items
        like registration, moderation, and AV support. Help us put on a great event for our community!
